# Data-Analysis-on-Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
The automation of the loan eligibility process will be based on the details provided by the customers while filing online application. Generally, information of the borrowers like the gender, education, whether or not they are self-employed ,their income, whether or not they are financially dependent on someone and if yes what is their income, their property area etc. are considered for predicting the loan status. Bank loan prediction has two classes, either loan can be allocated, or loan cannot be allocated for the customer so, it falls under the category of two class classification problem. Logistic model is suitable for the loan eligibility predication as it has only two values for the output variable, whether the loan is approved or not.

# Datasets: 
*train* This dataset is used to train the model
*test* This dataset is used to test the model

Run the loan.py file (Python3 required)

Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier is used to calculte the accuracy. Confusion matrix provides the comparison of both the classifiers.
